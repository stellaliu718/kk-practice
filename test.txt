test conflict file

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in a dramatic battle for the all-important state of Florida.

The Sunshine State, which carries 29 electoral votes, is a likely a must-win for Trump's presidential hopes.
With 91% of the vote in, he is leading Clinton 48.9% to 48%. There are still votes to be counted in Democratic strongholds such as Broward and Palm Beach Counties, 
but the race is emerging as one of the biggest nail-biters of the night.
As polls closed on the East Coast, Clinton won seven states and the District of Columbia, while Trump came out on top in eight states. Regardless of who prevails, history will be made as Americans elect either their first woman president or side with the ultimate political outsider.
The Democratic nominee has 68 electoral votes compared to 66 for her GOP rival, according to CNN projections. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
