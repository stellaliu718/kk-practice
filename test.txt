test conflict file

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in a dramatic battle for the all-important state of Florida.

The Sunshine State, which carries 29 electoral votes, is a likely a must-win for Trump's presidential hopes.
With 91% of the vote in, he is leading Clinton 48.9% to 48%. There are still votes to be counted in Democratic strongholds such as Broward and Palm Beach Counties, 
but the race is emerging as one of the biggest nail-biters of the night.

So many visits to Florida did it take to get a near-tie, anyway?

Glad you asked. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made a combined 25 visits to Florida, holding more than 45 events there since the conventions.

Clinton made 13 separate visits, and Trump 12.
